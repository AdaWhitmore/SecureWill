# üîê SecureWill

**A Privacy-Preserving Digital Will Registry Built on Blockchain and Fully Homomorphic Encryption**

SecureWill is a revolutionary decentralized application (dApp) that enables users to securely store their digital wills on the blockchain using advanced cryptographic techniques. By combining client-side encryption with Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology, SecureWill ensures that sensitive information remains private while being immutable and accessible when needed.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** 20 or higher
- **npm** 7.0.0 or higher
- **Git** for version control
- **Ethereum wallet** (MetaMask recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SecureWill.git
cd SecureWill
```

2. **Install Backend Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Install Frontend Dependencies**
```bash
cd ui
npm install
cd ..
```

4. **Environment Setup**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
# Wallet Configuration
MNEMONIC="your twelve word mnemonic phrase here"
PRIVATE_KEY="0x..."  # Optional: Alternative to mnemonic

# Network Configuration
INFURA_API_KEY="your_infura_api_key"
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY="your_etherscan_api_key"

# Development
REPORT_GAS=true
```

### Local Development

1. **Compile Smart Contracts**
```bash
npm run compile
```

2. **Run Tests**
```bash
npm test
```

3. **Start Local Blockchain**
```bash
npm run chain
```

4. **Deploy Contracts (New Terminal)**
```bash
npm run deploy:localhost
```

5. **Start Frontend (New Terminal)**
```bash
cd ui
npm run dev
```

6. **Access Application**
Open [http://localhost:5174](http://localhost:5174) in your browser

## üìñ How It Works

### The Encryption Process

SecureWill uses a unique dual-layer encryption approach:

1. **Key Generation**: User provides three Ethereum addresses (typically trusted lawyers or family members)
2. **Client-Side Encryption**: Will content is encrypted in the browser using these three addresses as keys
3. **FHE Encryption**: The three addresses themselves are encrypted using Zama's FHE technology
4. **Blockchain Storage**: Both encrypted will content and encrypted addresses are stored on-chain

### The Decryption Process

To decrypt and access a will:

1. **Address Retrieval**: Either decrypt the three addresses using Zama FHE or input them manually
2. **Will Decryption**: Use the three addresses to decrypt the will content client-side
3. **Access Control**: Only users with all three correct addresses can decrypt the will

### Security Guarantees

- **Privacy**: Will content never appears in plaintext on-chain or to third parties
- **Integrity**: Blockchain ensures content cannot be tampered with
- **Availability**: Decentralized storage prevents single points of failure
- **Access Control**: Multi-signature-style access requiring three separate keys

## üîß Smart Contract API

### Core Functions

#### `submitWill(string calldata encryptedWill, externalEaddress extAddr1, externalEaddress extAddr2, externalEaddress extAddr3, bytes calldata inputProof)`
Submits or updates a will with encrypted content and addresses.

**Parameters:**
- `encryptedWill`: Client-side encrypted will content
- `extAddr1-3`: FHE-encrypted external address handles
- `inputProof`: Zama input proof for encrypted addresses

#### `hasWill(address user) ‚Üí bool`
Checks if a user has a stored will.

#### `getEncryptedWill(address user) ‚Üí string`
Retrieves the encrypted will content for a user.

#### `getEncryptedAddresses(address user) ‚Üí (eaddress, eaddress, eaddress)`
Returns the three FHE-encrypted addresses for a user.

#### `getWillMeta(address user) ‚Üí (uint256, address)`
Returns metadata including timestamp and owner address.

### Events

#### `WillSubmitted(address indexed user, uint256 timestamp)`
Emitted when a will is successfully submitted or updated.
